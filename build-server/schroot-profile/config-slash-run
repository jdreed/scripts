# The debathena schroot profile is largely based on the "default"
# profile.  The major difference is an fstab entry that bind-mounts
# /afs, and also in this case bind-mounts /dev/shm to the right place
# See schroot.conf(5) and schroot-script-config(5) for further details.
# The files detailed below may also be edited to further customise
# this profile.

# Filesystems to mount inside the chroot.
FSTAB="/etc/schroot/default/fstab-slash-run"

# Files to copy from the host system into the chroot.
COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/default/copyfiles"

# System NSS databases to copy into the chroot.
NSSDATABASES="/etc/schroot/default/nssdatabases"
