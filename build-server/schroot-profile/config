# profile.  The major difference is an fstab entry that bind-mounts
# /afs
# See schroot.conf(5) and schroot-script-config(5) for further details.
# The files detailed below may also be edited to further customise
# this profile.

# Filesystems to mount inside the chroot.
FSTAB="/etc/schroot/debathena/fstab"

# Files to copy from the host system into the chroot.
COPYFILES="/etc/schroot/debathena/copyfiles"

# System NSS databases to copy into the chroot.
