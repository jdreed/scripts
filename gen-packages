# Usage: gen-packages [-c|-r] [LOCATION]

# Scans the repository or a checkout of it and generates a file named
# "packages" in the current directory containing a table of source
# package names and their corresponding directories.  Scanning a
# checkout is much faster, but relies on the checkout being
# sufficiently up to date.

# If -c is specified, scans a checkout.  If -r is specified, scans the
# repository.  -r is the default.

# If LOCATION is specified, it is used in preference to the canonical
# Athena repository trunk or the canonical source checkout.
