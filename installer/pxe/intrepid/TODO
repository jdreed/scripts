high:
- Non-cluster PXE installs need post-install network munging
  by install-athena10.sh in order to have usable net, since
  the ubuntu installer forces a DHCP config if the installer
  used DHCP.  So sad.
- the entire install session *really* needs to be logged
- increase the timeout for Ubuntu's DHCP request, since the netops
  servers can sometimes take longer.

low:
- sometimes there's a warning dialog about lv name reuse.
  figure out why and suppress it.
- installer script shouldn't assume eth0
- clean up "debathena but not cluster version" install option,
  maybe further split it.
- shuffle preseed stuff around; more of the .autoinstall stuff
  should probably move to common.  (perhaps selection of
  a default package set?)
- hack non-cluster preseed to not prompt for cd ejection.

some of what was done:
- add hacks to install-athena10.sh for noninteractive use
- push to MIT PXE servers
- have a "debathena but not cluster version" install option
