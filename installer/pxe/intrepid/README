This directory contains some basic setup stuff for a PXE-based Athena
10 installer.  If you're looking for basic Athena 10 install instructions, check out:

http://athena10.mit.edu/

This is largely a vanilla Ubuntu install; a DHCP server running a
standard PXELINUX setup invokes the debian netinstall kernel with an
invocation like:

LABEL athena10
   kernel intrepid-installer/i386/linux
   append auto=true locale=en_US console-setup/layoutcode=us console-setup/charmap=UTF-8 interface=auto url=http://18.18.1.12/linux/athena10-intrepid.preseed initrd=intrepid-installer/i386/initrd.gz DEBCONF_DEBUG=5 --

...after which the kernel loads the preseed file
(athena10-intrepid.preseed), which fetches and runs a loader script
(athena10-intrepid-loader.sh), which fetches, unpacks, and runs the real
install script (out of athena10-intrepid.tar.gz), which asks a few
questions up front and then generates a preseed file which can
complete the install without further input.

Most of this stuff is currently served via HTTP from athena10.mit.edu.
